<h1>Private Set Intersection</h1>

<h2>Flavors of PSI</h2>

There are multiple variations of PSI, which can be used to solve different problems:
<ul>
    <li><b>PSI-cardinality</b> - only the size of the intersection can be learned during the protocol.</li>
    <li><b>server-client PSI</b> - only the client learns the intersection, while the server learns nothing (this variant is utilized by Apple in password monitoring).</li>
    <li><b>server-aided PSI</b> - two parties exchange the intersection of their sets with the help of a third-party server.</li>
    <li><b>threshold PSI</b> - the elements (and the size!) of the intersection cannot be revealed, unless its size exceeds a fixed threshold (this variant is used by Apple for CSAM detection).</li>
    <li><b>dynamic input PSI</b> - this variant of the protocol is optimized for frequent updates to the sets of one of the sides.</li>
    <li><b>input consistent PSI</b> - this PSI variant ensures that the input of one of the sides must remain static between different runs of the protocol.</li>
    <li><b>PSI with enrichment</b> - this variant focuses on performing an exact or approximate join on two private databases.</li>
    <li><b>PSI with statistical analysis</b> - parties only learn results of a statistical analysis performed on the intersection of their datasets.</li>
</ul>
