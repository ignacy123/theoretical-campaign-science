<h1>Private Set Intersection</h1>

<h2>Problem definition</h2>

<p>Alice has a set of elements \( A = (a_1, \dots, a_n) \) and Bob has a set of elements \( B = (b_1, \dots,
    b_m) \).
    They wish to learn \( A \cap B \), but are unwilling to share any elements that are not in the intersection
    with each other.</p>
